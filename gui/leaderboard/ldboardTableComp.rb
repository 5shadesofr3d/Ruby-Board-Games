# This file contains all of the widget classes that will show the leaderboard table
# and the visualizer

# Taken from the player_lobby.rb files

# The following may need to be created, only if the table widget does not work

# Leaderboard Table
# Leaderboard Header
# Leaderboard sort/search buttons
# Leaderboard back button (maybe)
# Leaderboard row values (for each column)
	# => For the rows, there needs to be a limit set if scrolling is not available
	# => Think page by page
